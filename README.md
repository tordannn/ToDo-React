# Todo Application

It was designed to understand and put into practice the knowledge of main aspects of React. 

This app stands for a daily **ToDo** list which allows to keep track of your activities, namely:

* Add new tasks;
* Mark a task as important/done;
* Remove completed or unnecessary tasks;
* Filter the tasks by <code>All</code>, <code>Active</code>, <code>Done</code>.
* Search for a particular task;
* See the ToDo's list status with an exact number of `to do` or `... done` tasks.

To start using the application, you need to:

* `Git clone` the project to your local machine;
* Go to the folder and run `npm start`.
